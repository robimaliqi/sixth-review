String of comma seperated values with the test results from the schools

Build a programme that takes the string and builds a report from it.

Input | Ouput
"Green" | "Green: 1"
"Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red" | "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 2"

Edge cases:
"" "No results given"
wrong input (not a string) : Error "Input must be a comma-separated string"
incorrect spelling:
"Green,Dave,Whimsy,Red"
"Green: 1\nRed: 1\nUncounted: 2"

Use more descriptive name rather than input, test results or grades

makes it easier for someone to understand what the code actually does
